# CHESS WITH MACHINE LEARNING

# **ML Chess Game**

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Chess AI that can analyze and predict optimal moves. It leverages advanced algorithms, state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence, and chess heuristics to create an engaging chess-playing experience.

---

## Features  
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Play against the AI on an interactive chessboard.  
- **Move Prediction**: Predict optimal moves for any given board position.  
- **Training Models**: Train custom machine learning models using game datasets.  
- **Evaluation**: Analyze the performance of the AI using Elo ratings and other metrics.  
- **Visualization**: See game simulations and AI thought processes with detailed visualizations.

## **Technologies Used**
- JavaScript (97%): Implements the chess logic, AI, and interactivity.
- CSS (1.3%): Styles the chessboard and pieces.
- HTML (1%): Provides the basic structure of the game.

## How It Works  
1. **Model Architecture**: The chess engine is powered by a neural network trained on millions of chess games.  
2. **Input Representation**: Board positions are represented as feature matrices.  
3. **Training**: The AI is trained to evaluate positions and predict optimal moves using supervised or reinforcement learning techniques.  
4. **Move Selection**: The AI uses the modelâ€™s evaluation to select moves, incorporating alpha-beta pruning or other search techniques for efficiency.
